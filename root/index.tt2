      <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is Perl Mongers?</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Perl Mongers are a very loose community of Perl 5 (programmers|hackers|developers) across the world, organized into local chapters.
        Typically, most groups meet once or twice a month either as a mostly social event with other Perl developers, or occasionally to 
        to have relatively informal Perl-related presentations.
      </p>
      <p class='lead'>
        We don't have much in the way of scheduled meetings yet, but I'm aiming to change that.  I'd like to have our very first meeting in
        early October 2013.  If you'd be interested, please hop on the mailing list and send out your ideas of any good places (preferably 
        in the South Jakarta area).  
      </p>

        Perlis a language that's been around since the early days of the web and still has a vibrant community to this day.
        The Perl interpreter ships by default with Linux and Mac OS.  It's also incredibly easy to install and use on Windows.
        In addition to the interpreter, perl ships with a package manager called cpan and includes build scripts that ship
        with the core language features.  You can have a look around at the available Perl modules 
        <a href='http://www.cpan.org/'>cpan.org</a> or <a href='http://www.metacpan.org/'>metacpan.org</a>.

      <p class='lead'>
        I've developed this site to serve two purposes:  The first is the standard funtion of this site --
        allow for organizing of events and news, in addition to the mailing list.  The second, is to display
        an example of how to properly build a site using one of the most popular Perl MVC frameworks -- Catalyst.
        The full source is available <a href='https://github.com/derekjamescurtis/jakartapm'>here, on Github</a>.  In addition to Catalyst, Perl also has two 
        other popular web frameworks in widespread use: Dancer, (a microframework) and Mojolicious (An event-driven,
        non-blocking framework).  All three are great, but Catalyst is the most mature of the group so that's what 
        I wanted to present the example in.
